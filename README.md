## Day 2
Lets consider 2 parallel plates connected with a battery of "V" volts.After sometimes of battery connection let the plate connected with the cathode of battery has total charge +Q on its surface and 
the plate connected with the anode of battery has total charge -Q on its surface .\
Gradually as the charge increases on the plate potential also increases.Let the potential on the plates are V1 and V2 respectively .\
Relation between total charge on either plate and potential difference between two parallel plates (V= V1-V2) can be mathematically expressed as:

$$ Q \propto V $$
 
Here the proportionality constant is the capacitance of the parallel plates :
 
 $$ Q = CV .......................(1)$$  
 
We will apply Gauss's theorem to calculate the capacitance of the parallel plates .\
Gauss Theorem can mathemticallly expressed as

$$\Phi_E = \oint\limits_S\overrightarrow{E} . \overrightarrow{dS} = \frac{Q _{in}}{\epsilon_o} .........................................(2)$$

$$ EA=  \frac{Q _{in}}{\epsilon_o} $$

Q can be expressed as :

$$ Q=\overrightarrow{E}.A.\epsilon_o ...................(3) $$

Assuming a large area and small separation "d" between plates , Electric feild between plates can be expressed mathematically 

$$ \overrightarrow{E} = \frac{V}{d}...........................(4)$$

From the equation 1 Capacitance C can be :

$$C= \frac{Q}{V} $$

Therefore putting the values of Q and V from equation 3 and 4 the capacitance of the parallel plates can be expressed as:

 $$ C=\frac{\epsilon_0 \cdot AE}{Ed} = \frac{\epsilon_0 \cdot A}{d} ............................(5)$$
