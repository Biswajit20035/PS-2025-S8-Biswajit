## Day 2
Lets consider 2 parallel plates connected with a battery of "V" volts.After sometimes of battery connection  Let the plate connected with the cathode of battery has total charge +Q on its surface and 
the plate connected with the anode of battery has total charge -Q on its surface and the potential difference between on the plates are V1 and V2 respectively.\
Relation between total charge(Q) and potential difference between two parallel plates (V= V1-V2) can be mathematicaaly expressed as 

 $$ Q \propto V $$
 
 Here the proportionality constant is the capacitance of the parallel plates :
 
 $$ Q = CV .......................(1)$$  
 
We will apply Gauss's theorem to calculate the capacitance of the paralle plates .\
Gauss Theorem can mathemticallly expressed as

$$\Phi_E = \oint\limits_S\overrightarrow{E} . \overrightarrow{dS} = \frac{Q _{in}}{\epsilon_o} .........................................(2)$$

$$ Q=\overrightarrow{E}.A.\epsilon_o $$


$\epsilon$<sub>o</sub> .A.E \
Assuming a large area and small separation "d" between plates , Electric feild between plates can be expressed mathematically 

$$ \overrightarrow{E} = \frac{V}{d}$$

From the equation 1 :

 $$C= \frac{Q}{V} $$

 Therefore the capacitance of the parallel plates can be expressed as:
 
 $$ C=\frac{\epsilon_0 \cdot AE}{Ed}$$

 $$ C= \frac{\epsilon_0 \cdot A}{d}$$
