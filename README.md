## Day 2
Lets consider 2 parallel plates connected with a battery of "V" volts.After sometimes of battery connection  Let the plate connected with the cathode of battery has total charge +Q on its surface and 
the plate connected with the anode of battery has total charge -Q on its surface and the potential difference between on the plates are V1 and V2 respectively.
Relation between total charge(Q) and potential difference between two parallel plates (V= V1-V2) can be mathematicaaly expressed as 

 $$ q \propto V $$

Gauss's theorem mathemticallly expressed as

### Gauss's Theorem (Divergence Theorem)

Gauss's Theorem states that the flux of a vector field **F** through a closed surface **S** is equal to the volume integral of the divergence of **F** over the region **V** enclosed by **S**.

$$\Phi_E = \oint\limits_S\overrightarrow{E} . \overrightarrow{dS} = \frac{Q _{in}}{\epsilon_o} $$

$$ Q=\overrightarrow{E}.A.\epsilon_o $$

where:
- \(\partial V\) is the closed surface bounding the volume \(V\)
- \(\mathbf{F}\) is the vector field
- \(d\mathbf{A}\) is the outward-pointing unit normal vector on the surface \(S\)
- \(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}\) is the divergence of \(\mathbf{F}\)

$\epsilon$<sub>o</sub> .A.E \
Assuming a large area and small separation "d" between plates , Electric feild between plates can be expressed mathematically 

$$ \overrightarrow{E} = \frac{V}{d}$$

 $$C= \frac{Q}{V} $$

 Therefore the capacitance of the parallel plates can be expressed as:
 
 $$ C=\frac{\epsilon_0 \cdot AE}{Ed}$$

 $$ C= \frac{\epsilon_0 \cdot A}{d}$$
